## Is RAP relevant to me?

::: {.incremental}

-   Would it be a nightmare to have to go back and rerun your process from the beginning if you found a mistake?

-   Do you have to make a lot of manual edits to code before each run?

-   Is there a lot of repetition in your code?

-   Would a new person find it difficult to understand the process?

:::

::: notes
-   If the answer to any of these is yes, then RAP could help you.

## What is RAP?

* An overall approach to analysis

* Automated statistical and analytical processes that are:

  -   Reproducible

  -   Auditable

  -   Efficient

  -   High quality

::: notes
-   A RAP approach an be applied to all stages of analysis; data extraction, cleaning, analysis, modelling, visualisation and reporting.

-   Reproducible means that a process can be repeated at some point in the future and will produce the same result.

-   Auditable means that it is clear who, when and why decisions have been made.

-   Efficient means that a process is as simple as possible, with no redundant steps.

-   High quality means that you are confident your process is doing what you expect it to, often demonstrated by peer review.

-   More information on these principles can be found in the [Duck book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/principles.html)

-   There are lots of things you could do to work towards these, but the Government Analysis Function have outlined 7 core features to aim for

:::


## RAP principles (1)

In order to achieve the full benefits, at a minimum a RAP must:

::: {.incremental}

* Minimise manual steps

* Be built using open-source software; e.g. R, Python

* Be peer reviewed by colleagues

:::

:::

::: {.notes}
* Examples of manual steps: creating new folders, copying and pasting data, restructuring data, updating parameters (year, geographies), creating outputs (charts, excel tables, reports, dashboards) 
:::


## RAP principles (2)

::: {.incremental}

* Be version controlled; e.g. Git

* Be open to anyone; e.g. code published on GitHub

* Follow good practice for quality assurance

* Contain well-commented code and have documentation embedded

:::

::: {.notes}
* It is not essential to do all of these at once. Start small and iterate.
* This is where using agile project management can be useful to encourage iterative development and continuous review.

## Self-assessment tool

* [RAP Self-Assessment Tool](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/sg-rap-self-assessment/) developed internally for analysts in the Scottish Government.

* Specific criteria for RAP categorised into 4 'levels': Aspiring, Fundamental, Intermediate and Advanced.

* Description and links to further resources for each criteria.

* Complete form and download report to track progress and inform next steps.


## Top tips

* Create a process map and make a plan

* Don't be restricted by the current set up

* Use the [RAP Self-Assessment Tool](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/sg-rap-self-assessment/)

* Start small and improve iteratively

* [Get support from the Data Innovation team](https://scotsconnect.sharepoint.com/sites/StatisticsGroup-Org-SG/SitePages/Support-for-Reproducible-Analytical-Pipelines.aspx)

::: {.notes}
* Create a process map of your existing process (and maybe a process map for your aspirational process)

* RAP isn't about replicating / shoehorning an existing process into new software. Step back - look at what you have to start with, what you'd like to end up with and the most logical way of getting from one to the other. It's easy to assume processes are complex and convoluted for unavoidable reasons, but often they're just a result of years of different analysts adding new layers on top of old ones until it doesn't make sense anymore!

* You don't need to overhaul the entire project all at once. Can you isolate a section from your process map? Test a RAP approach on this section, make improvements and learn lessons for next phase.

* Learn from others around you. There may be others in your division who can help you or are willing to be a critical friend. My team (Data Innovation team) can also provide support.

## Project examples

* School Information Dashboards ([Read the blog](https://blogs.gov.scot/statistics/2023/07/24/reproducible-analytical-pipelines-how-we-saved-3-analysts-6-weeks-of-copying-and-pasting/))

* Centralised Surveys ([View the code on GitHub](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis/cssampling))

* Planned Care (Blog coming soon)

::: {.notes}
* Project types: 
  * SID: Shiny dashboards
  * Central surveys: data files
  * PC: Variety of outputs for internal use 
* Time savings:
  * SID: 90 days to 2 days a year
  * PC: 3 days to 1 hour a week
* Other benefits:
  * Improved quality
  * Reduced risk of errors
  * Improved documentation / easier to understand
  * Able to spend time on other higher value work
