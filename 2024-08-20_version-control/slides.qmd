## What is version control?

Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to files. 

Does this look familiar?

## Git 

![](images/git.svg){.absolute alt="git logo" top=25 right=50 height=75}

Git is a free and open source software for version control. 

It allows you to:

* Record any changes you make to files (these records are called 'commits')

* Undo changes and revert to previous version of files (if required)

* Collaborate with others on the same project using 'branches'

::: {.notes}
Using Git means you don’t need to save multiple copies of the same file to retain older versions. This information is stored by Git.
:::


## Git Commits {.smaller}

![](images/git.svg){.absolute alt="git logo" top=25 right=50 height=75}

Commits contain information on:

* **what** change was made,
* **when** the change was made,
* **why** the change was made, and
* **who** made the change.

Git tracks changes to the content of files, not just the file as a whole. This means the information above can be recorded for changes as small as one character on one line of code.


## What is in a code repository?

A version controlled code repository will usually contain files for one project and can contain:

* Code (e.g. R scripts)
* Documentation (e.g. README)
* Configuration files
* ...but [**NOT DATA**]{style="color:#D72828;"}!

::: {.notes}
* If you're using R, your code repository will be your RStudio Project.

* NOT DATA because: Git is not designed to track changes to data files; when using Git in conjunction with GitHub, you will often not want to publish the data files you're using in your code.
:::


## Ignoring files

* A `.gitignore` file tells Git which files in the code repository it shouldn't track changes to.

* Can include specific files, folders or file extensions

* Use the [Scottish Government template .gitignore](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis/welcome/blob/main/.gitignore) to get started.

* More information on using Git safely can be found in the [Duck Book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/version_control.html#avoid-commiting-sensitive-information-to-git-repositories).

::: {.notes}
* Examples; csv files, a 'data' folder, or a config.yml file

* Alternatively, these files can be stored outside of your code repository.

* Ensuring data or other sensitive information isn't tracked by Git becomes more important if you start using GitHub.
:::


## GitHub {.smaller}

![](images/github.svg){.absolute alt="GitHub logo" top=25 right=50 height=75}

GitHub is a web interface for hosting version controlled code and can be used to:

* Make code publicly available (although repositories can also be private)

* Facilitate code review (using 'pull requests')

* Manage projects using tools such as issue tracking

* Navigate Git history and view previous versions of files

* View other people's code and collaborate


## GitHub Organisation

## How to use Git and GitHub

* Git can be used without GitHub

* GitHub is often used as the main copy of a code repository (or 'remote'). Analysts or developers can take a copy (or 'clone') of the repository from GitHub to work on locally.

* Use Git locally to track changes and regularly 'push' to GitHub

* Use GitHub to facilitate code review and merging of branches

::: {.notes}
* Git is used via a terminal-like tool called Git Bash, or via RStudio.
:::


## Why use Git and GitHub? {.smaller}

* Preferable to lots of copies of the same file with various names!

* [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines (RAP)](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/support/reproducible-analytical-pipelines/)

   * **Reproducible**: You can rerun your code as it was at any point in time.
   
   * **Auditable**: You have a record of when changes were made and why.
   
   * **Transparent**: Code is publicly available on GitHub and available for others to review or reuse.
   
   * **Good quality**: Code review is built into the GitHub workflow.


## Getting started on SCOTS (1)

* Familiarise yourself with the [Version Control guidance page](https://scotsconnect.sharepoint.com/sites/StatisticsGroup-Org-SG/SitePages/Version-Control.aspx) on SharePoint

* Explore the public code repositories in the [Scottish Government Analysis GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis) to see how other teams are using Git and GitHub

* [Install and set up Git on your SCOTS laptop](https://scotsconnect.sharepoint.com/sites/StatisticsGroup-Org-SG/SitePages/Version-Control.aspx#using-git-within-scots)

## Getting started on SCOTS (2)

* Read the [Scottish Government GitHub User Responsibilities](https://scotsconnect.sharepoint.com/sites/StatisticsGroup-Org-SG/SitePages/GitHub-User-Responsibilities.aspx) document

* [Create a free GitHub account](https://github.com/join) (if you don't already have one)

* [Join the Scottish Government Analysis GitHub organisation](https://github.com/ScotGovAnalysis/welcome/issues/new/choose)
   
* [Join the SSH security group and set up an SSH key](https://scotsconnect.sharepoint.com/sites/StatisticsGroup-Org-SG/SitePages/Version-Control.aspx#connecting-to-github-on-scots)

::: {.notes}
* An SSH key allows Git (installed on your laptop) to communicate with GitHub.
