## What is RAP?

* An overall approach to analysis

::: {.incremental}

* Automated statistical and analytical processes that are:

  -   Reproducible

  -   Auditable

  -   Efficient

  -   High quality

::: notes
-   A RAP approach an be applied to all stages of analysis; data extraction, cleaning, analysis, modelling, visualisation and reporting.

-   Reproducible means that a process can be repeated at some point in the future and will produce the same result.

-   Auditable means that it is clear who, when and why decisions have been made.

-   Efficient means that a process is as simple as possible, with no redundant steps.

-   High quality means that you are confident your process is doing what you expect it to, often demonstrated by peer review.

## RAP principles (1)

In order to achieve the full benefits, at a minimum a RAP must:

::: {.incremental}

* Minimise manual steps

* Be built using open-source software; e.g. R, Python

* Be peer reviewed by colleagues

:::

::: {.notes}
* Examples of manual steps: creating new folders, copying and pasting data, restructuring data, updating parameters (year, geographies), creating outputs (charts, excel tables, reports, dashboards) 
:::


## RAP principles (2)

::: {.incremental}

* Be version controlled; e.g. Git

* Be open to anyone; e.g. code published on GitHub

* Follow good practice for quality assurance

* Contain well-commented code and have documentation embedded

## Is RAP relevant to me?

::: {.incremental}

-   Would it be a nightmare to have to go back and rerun your process from the beginning if you found a mistake?

-   Do you have to make a lot of manual edits to code before each run?

-   Is there a lot of repetition in your code?

-   Would a new person find it difficult to understand the process?

:::

::: notes
-   If the answer to any of these is yes, then RAP could help you.

## Self-assessment tool

* [RAP Self-Assessment Tool](https://scotland.shinyapps.io/sg-rap-self-assessment/) developed internally for analysts in the Scottish Government.

* Criteria categorised into 4 'levels': Aspiring, Fundamental, Intermediate and Advanced.

* Description and links to further resources for each criteria.

* Complete form and download report to track progress and inform next steps.


## Examples

* Either icons from previous slides or example criteria?


## Top tips

* Create a process map of your existing process (or your aspirational process)

* Start small and iterate (Agile project development helps here!)

* Learn from others around you. Find somebody who can be a critical friend.
