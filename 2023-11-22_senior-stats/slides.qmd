## About me

* Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) developer

* Background in statistics and data analysis


## Why should I care about RAP?

::: {.incremental}
<br>

* Less time spent producing routine analysis; more time for other work

<div style="line-height:50%;"><br></div>

* Better quality analysis

:::

::: {.notes}
* In every RAP project I've worked on, we've discovered an error in the existing code. These often went undiscovered for so long because they were hidden amongst complicated, convoluted processes.

* Creating a RAP not only helps you to weed out these existing errors; it makes them easier to identify and rectify in the future.

## What is RAP?

* An overall approach to carrying out analysis

* A set of principles that ensure analysis is:

   * reproducible
   * auditable
   * efficient
   * high quality
   
::: {.notes}
* Reproducible means that a process can be repeated at some point in the future and will produce the same result.

* Auditable means that it is clear who, when and why decisions have been made.

* Efficient means that a process is as simple as possible, with no redundant steps.

* High quality means that you are confident your process is doing what you expect it to, often demonstrated by peer review.

* More information on these principles can be found in the [Duck book](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/principles.html)

## Examples of projects

* Routine 'traditional' publications

* Shiny dashboards

* Ministerial briefings

* FOIs

* One-off analysis
   
   
## Stages of analysis

* Data extraction

* Data cleaning

* Data analysis

* Modelling

* Data visualisation

* Reporting


## RAP principles {.smaller}

In order to achieve the full benefits, at a minimum a RAP must:

* Minimise manual steps

* Be built using open-source software; e.g. R, python

* Be peer reviewed by colleagues

* Be version controlled; e.g. git

* Be open to anyone; e.g. code published on GitHub

* Follow good practice for quality assurance

* Contain well-commented code and have documentation embedded

:::


## Where to start

* Following all 7 principles will help you to achieve the **full benefits**

<div style="line-height:50%;"><br></div>

::: {.incremental}

* Following one or some of the principles will **still bring benefits!**

<div style="line-height:50%;"><br></div>

* Start small, review and iterate

## RAP Support

* Data Innovation team

* The aim is to help you to develop your RAP skills, not to write all the code for you.

* Agreement to work together for 4-6 months

* Regular meetings to review progress

* Code reviews
