This site contains presentation slides and blogs I have written.

I currently work as a Reproducible Analytical Pipeline (RAP) developer at the Scottish Government. Prior to this, I worked at Public Health Scotland (PHS) analysing data on topics such as Delayed Discharges, Dementia and Palliative and End of Life Care.

A lot of my work is open and available on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/alicebyers5).
