## What is RAP?

Automated statistical and analytical processes that are:

-   Reproducible

-   Auditable

-   Efficient

-   High quality

## Features of RAP {.smaller}

At minimum, a RAP must:

-   Minimise manual steps

-   Be built using open-source software; e.g. R, python

-   Be peer reviewed by colleagues

-   Be version controlled; e.g. git

-   Be open to anyone; e.g. code published on GitHub

-   Follow good practice for quality assurance

-   Contain well-commented code and have documentation embedded

## RAP Strategy {.smaller}

-   Developed by Government Analysis Function to help analysts and analyst leaders understand why RAP is important and how to deliver it.

-   Vision: RAP is the default approach to analysis

-   Three goals

    -   Tools

    -   Capability

    -   Culture

## Case Study - Existing Process

-   School Information Dashboards

-   10 data sources

-   Data cleaned, linked and analysed manually in Excel

-   Dashboards created in Tableau

-   Updated twice a year; each update took three weeks of work for three statisticians - longer if errors were found


## Case Study - Planning

-   Engage with SG RAP support team

-   Define aims -- what will success look like?

-   Mock ups of what dashboards would look like

-   Planning how best to structure datasets

-   Work with data providers to improve process

## Case Study - Result

-   Faster

    -   Previously took three weeks for three statisticians (twice per year)

    -   Now takes at most half a day for one statistician (twice per year)

-   More accurate

-   Reduced risk

-   Well documented

-   Developed skills to apply to other projects
