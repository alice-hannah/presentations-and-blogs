# sgplot: An R package for accessible data visualisations in the Scottish Government

[sgplot](https://scotgovanalysis.github.io/sgplot/) is an R package for creating accessible data visualisations in the Scottish Government. 
The package includes a ggplot2 theme, organisation branded colour palettes and a comprehensive guidance website.

sgplot has been developed in-house to meet the needs of the large group of analytical staff using R in the organisation.

All content published on public sector websites, including official statistics publications, must meet certain accessibility standards. 
The sgplot theme applies accessibility best practices to the style elements of the data visualisation, and colour palettes have been designed to meet minimum colour contrast ratios.

Use of the package also promotes consistency across official statistics data visualisations produced in the organisation, both in quality and visual branding. 
This builds trust with our users.

The [guidance website](https://scotgovanalysis.github.io/sgplot/index.html) contains information on how to use the package, as well as further context on accessibility and use of colour. 
The website also has a [cookbook](https://scotgovanalysis.github.io/sgplot/articles/cookbook.html) containing example code to produce various types of data visualisation using sgplot.

The sgplot package is now widely used across the Scottish Government and has recently been [adapted by the UK-wide Government Analysis Function](https://analysisfunction.civilservice.gov.uk/blog/automated-data-visualisation-best-practice-in-r-afcharts-release/) to create the [afcharts package](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/afcharts/index.html).
